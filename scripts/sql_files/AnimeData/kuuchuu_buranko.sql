He and his charming nurse Mayumi run through several patients, each suffering from a mental illness that harms their everyday life. <br>
<br>Patients should be wary of the seductive Mayumi, with her spellbinding looks and devilishly short pink nurse uniform. On the other hand, the doctor seems to have three separate personalities: a child with an oversized lab coat an intelligent, youthful man with feminine traits and a selfish, outgoing green bear. While curing his patients in questionable ways, Dr. Irabu often tries to gain something from them outside of his professionâ€”and in doing so, occasionally forgets his role as a doctor.<br>
<br>As each patient struggles to face the nature of their distress, an obvious yet invisible thread ties their paths together.<br>
