However, much to her surprise, the once active senior has ended up becoming a "lonesome" student, preferring to spend his free time in quiet peace.<br>
<br>Uzaki does whatever she can to keep Sakurai from being "alone," from convincing him to go to the movies to going to his part-time workplace. While Sakurai finds her irritating and tiresome, he still goes along with Uzaki', CHAR(39), 's hijinks and shenanigans, even if he knows that her perky personality will only lead the two of them into various comical situations.<br>
